# LCA
This is my repository for the first programming work for Software Engineering. I chose to do the LCA of a Binary Tree in Python ancd C++. This is the repository for C++ 

# PYTHON
I chose Python as the langauge I have done before as I like the syntax and how easy it is to write Python. I also like all the extensions for Python to aid in your experience in VS code. It is my favourite language I have done so far.

# C++
I chose to do C++ the language I have not done as I enjoy working in Java and Python as they are object orientated but I also liked how C used pointers to point to "structs" as there version of objects. I heard C++ was a balace of C and Java and was a "semi OOL" so I thought it would be interesting to see how it worked around structs and objects and how complex or basic it really was. 

# CONCLUSION    
While I did enjoy working with C++ and seeing how objects worked in a semi OOL language, I did not enjoy it as much as I enjoy writing Python. I think the next language i would like to try in C# as it is still a C variant language but is a fully OOL
